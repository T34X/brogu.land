title: Custom text underlines
---

The `text-decoration: underline` CSS property provides insufficient control over the underline styling and position. While we wait for the
[CSS Text Decoration Module specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-text-decor-4/) to become standard, we must rely on custom implementations.

My favorite approach is to use a `linear-gradient` to create an underline:

```css
background-image: linear-gradient(gray, gray);
background-size: 100% 1px;
background-position: left bottom;
background-repeat: no-repeat;
```

<div class="l">
  <div>
    <span>Day by day, what you do is what you become.</span>
  </div>
</div>

## Position

Position the underline by changing the vertical value of `background-position`:

```css
background-position: left 1.05em;
```

<div class="l _2">
  <div>
    <span>Day by day, what you do is what you become.</span>
  </div>
</div>

## Descenders

You'll notice that the underline overlaps the [descenders](https://www.figma.com/dictionary/descender/) of the text. By adding a `text-shadow` with a small
offset to the right and left with the color of the background, you can hide the underline around descenders.

```css
text-shadow: 0.1em 0 var(--background), -0.1em 0 var(--background);
```

<div class="l _2 _3">
  <div>
    <span>Day by day, what you do is what you become.</span>
  </div>
</div>

Remember to set `text-shadow: none` in your `::selection` rules.

## Weight

Change the height of the background to increase the underline weight:

```css
background-size: 100% 0.25em;
```

<div class="l _4">
  <div>
    <span>Day by day, what you do is what you become.</span>
  </div>
</div>

## Dashes

By using a `repeating-linear-gradient` and leaving half the gradient transparent, you can customize a dashed underline:

```css
background-image: repeating-linear-gradient(to right, var(--gray) 0%, var(--gray) 50%, transparent 50%, transparent 100%);
background-size: 1ch 1px;
```

<div class="l _5">
  <div>
    <span>Day by day, what you do is what you become.</span>
  </div>
</div>

Change the horizontal value of `background-size` to modify the dash width:

```css
background-size: 5ch 1px;
```

<div class="l _5 _6">
  <div>
    <span>Day by day, what you do is what you become.</span>
  </div>
</div>

The `ch` unit is equal to the width of the "0" glyph in the current font, which can be useful for natural alignment.

## Wrapping

Lastly, this approach also supports multi-line text:

<div class="l">
  <div>
    <span>Day by day,<br /> what you do is what you become.</span>
  </div>
</div>
