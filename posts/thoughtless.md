title: Thoughtless
---

I have trouble falling asleep. Too many ideas and thoughts from a day with too little activity, I suspect. Writing down my thoughts helps me clear my mind.

[Thoughtless](https://thoughtless.now.sh) is an experiment, created on a sleepless night, to help me note my thoughts without interruption.

By making each typed word disappear, there is no overediting or obsessing over sentence structure. Record your raw thoughts â€” no going back.

When you finish, copy and paste your writing somewhere safe and sleep well.
